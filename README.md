## 📌 Problem Statement

The spread of misinformation in United States becomes massve.Thousands of hoax news articles are shared daily on social media platforms, leading to confusion and mistrust among the public. for this reason, it is crucial to develop an automated system that can accurately classify news articles as hoax or real.

This project aims to:

- Develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles as hoax or real based on their content.
- Analyze linguistic and contextual features that differentiate hoax news from real news.
- Evaluate the model's performance using **recall** as the primary metric to ensure that hoax news articles are correctly identified.
